In order to better understand his journey that led him to make such an important conclusion eventually, is analyzed and published by Jamie Murdock, Colin Allen, and Simon DeDeo in their paper- “Exploration and Exploitation of Victorian Science in Darwin’s Reading Notebooks”. This research paper performs information foraging by going through the records of the books he read from 1837 to 1860, a period where he went through a number of significant epochs which finally culminated in the publication of his major work – _“The Origin of Species”_.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry forward the work on Darwin information foraging, I am going to apply some more techniques of data analytics to try to find more insights that the data can provide. The data available to me includes KL divergence between the books, probability distribution of topics (20, 40, 60, 80), list of all the topics, raw data, as well as some metadata about the books.\r\n\r\n##PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS\r\nPCA is the first step in analyzing this data since the data is high dimensional ranging from 20 variables to 80 variables depending on the number of topics we select. Ideally, PCA returns the low dimensional representation of data and the amount of variance captured by each of the principal components. \r\n\r\n![PCA](https://github.com/abhie19/Project-Darwin/blob/master/Images/PC.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nPrincipal component representation of 40 Topic dataset and 80 topic dataset represent that the first 2 components capture most of the variance in data. This information would further be used to visualize data in 2 dimension.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
