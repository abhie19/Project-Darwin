# Project Darwin

Introduction

Techniques used to manipulate high dimensional data and transform it to lower dimensions for ease of analysis and visualization, can provide some great insights if applied to a capable dataset. This project has been built upon and is an extension to an earlier paper- “Exploration and Exploitation of Victorian Science in Darwin’s Reading Notebooks”. The paper implemented some novel techniques to extract very useful information and pattern from the data of Charles Darwin’s notebook where he kept his reading records. In order to delve deeper in this rich dataset, I applied data analysis techniques learned throughout the semester, including- Principal Component Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, Isomap, K-means and Spectral Clustering, and some additional proximity measures like Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, JS Distance, KL-Divergence and Angle Dissimilarity. The results obtained give further insights into the mind of Charles Darwin through the books he read.
